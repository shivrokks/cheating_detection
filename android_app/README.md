- Camera permission
- Internet connection
- Running cheating detection server with ngrok

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Install Pre-built APK
1. Download the latest APK from the releases page
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your Android settings
3. Install the APK file

#### Option 2: Build from Source

- **Red indicators**: Suspicious behavior detected
- **Detailed results**: Show specific detection information

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

Access settings from the main screen to configure:

### Video Settings
- **Frame Quality** (30-100%): Higher quality = better detection but slower upload
- **Frame Interval** (0.5-5.0s): How often frames are sent to server

### Connection Settings

### Key Components
- **MainActivity**: Server configuration and connection testing
- **CameraActivity**: Video streaming and detection display
- **SettingsActivity**: App configuration
- **ApiService**: REST API and WebSocket communication

### Network Communication
- **REST API**: For health checks and single frame processing
- **WebSocket**: For real-time video streaming and results
- **Base64 Encoding**: For image transmission over JSON

### Permissions Required
- `CAMERA`: For video capture
- `INTERNET`: For server communication
- `RECORD_AUDIO`: For future audio streaming features
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: For saving logs (optional)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **"Connection Failed"**: Check if server is running and ngrok URL is correct
- **"Server Error"**: Verify server is healthy using the test connection feature
- **Slow Performance**: Reduce frame quality or increase frame interval in settings

### Camera Issues
- **"Camera Permission Denied"**: Grant camera permission in Android settings
- **"Camera Initialization Failed"**: Restart the app or check if another app is using the camera

### Detection Issues
- **No Detection Results**: Ensure good lighting and face is visible
- **Inaccurate Results**: Wait for calibration to complete and maintain steady position

## üì± Supported Devices

### Minimum Requirements
- Android 7.0 (API level 24)
- 2GB RAM
- Rear or front camera
- Internet connectivity

### Recommended Specifications
- Android 9.0+ for better camera performance
- 4GB+ RAM for smooth operation
- Good lighting conditions
- Stable WiFi connection

## üîí Privacy & Security

- Video frames are only sent to your configured server
- No data is stored on external servers
- All communication uses your ngrok tunnel
- Camera access is only active during detection sessions

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check server logs** for error messages
2. **Verify ngrok tunnel** is active and accessible
3. **Test with different network** (WiFi vs mobile data)
4. **Check Android version compatibility**
5. **Review app permissions** in Android settings
